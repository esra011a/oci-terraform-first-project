# oci-terraform-first-project
This OCI Terraform project automates cloud infrastructure provisioning, replacing slow manual setups with fast, consistent deployments. It creates a VCN with public and private subnets, a web server in the public subnet, and AI/DR instances in private subnets connected to OCI storage services.
